### 完整 Plan Prompt
```markdown
# Standard Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase 
   for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.

2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you 
   can check off as you complete them

3. Before you begin working, check in with me and 
   I will verify the plan.

4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking 
   them as complete as you go.

5. Please every step of the way just give me a high 
   level explanation of what changes you made

6. Make every task and code change you do as simple 
   as possible. We want to avoid making any massive 
   or complex changes. Every change should impact 
   as little code as possible.

7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file 
   with a summary of the changes you made and any 
   other relevant information.
